# VLSI-LAB-EXP-6

AIM: To design and simulate the CMOS inverter and observe the DC and transient responses using cadence tool. 

APPARATUS REQUIRED:

    Laptop with MobaXterm
    Cadence tool PROCEDURE Creating a new library:
    In the library manager, execute File - New library. The new library form appears.
    In the new library form, type ‘my design lib’ in the name section.
    In the field of directory section, verify that the path to the library is set to ~/Database / Cadence- analog – lab –bl3 and click ok.
    In the next ‘technology file for new library form select option attach to an existing tech file and click ok.
    In the ‘attach design library to technology file’ form, select gpdk045 form the cyclic field and click ok.
    After creating a new library you can verify it from the library manager.
    If you right click on the ‘my design lib’ and select properties, you will find that gpdk045 library is attached as techlib to ‘my design lib’.

Creating a schematic cell view:

    In the CIW or library manager, execute file – new – cell viw.
    Setup the new file form as follows, Do not edit the library path file and the above might be different from the path shown in your form.
    Click ok when done the above setting. A black schematic window for the inverter design appears.

Adding components to schematic:

    In the inverter schematic window, click the instance fixed menu icon to display the add instance form.
    Click on the browse button. This opens up a library browser from which you can select components and the symbol view.
    After you complete the add instance form move your cursor to the schematic window and click left to place a component.
    This is a table of components for building the inverter schematic.
    After entering components, click cancel in the add instance form or press ESC with your cursor in the schematic window.
